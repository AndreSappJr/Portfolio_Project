<p class = "bio" >Hello everyone, my name is Andre Sapp this is my portfolio project. This will be updated
    regularly to track the progress I'm making with programming. I originally started learning programming
    3 years ago around February 2020. My progress was slow, in the first two years I only learned some basic
    HTML, albeit on my own. Frustrated with my lack of progress, and missed opportunites for growth at my
    current position, I decided to take MERN Stack front and back end development classes from an MIT coding camp.
    This webpage is a totality of what I've learned so far, and provides a roadmap of what I will and want to learn in
    the future.</p>
